Optimal Feature Combination (19 core features → 46 after encoding)

1. Core Structural Features (Highest Impact)

- Overall Qual (0.799 correlation) - Most important single predictor
- Total_SF (computed: basement + 1st + 2nd floor SF, 0.796 correlation)
- Gr Liv Area (0.706 correlation) - Above ground living area

2. Quality Scores (Strong Categorical Predictors)

- Kitchen_Quality_Score (computed from Kitchen Qual, 0.661 correlation)
- Exter_Quality_Score (computed from Exter Qual)
- Bsmt_Quality_Score (computed from Bsmt Qual, 0.598 correlation)

3. Garage & Transportation

- Garage Cars (0.647 correlation)
- Garage_Score (computed: Cars × Area/1000)

4. Bathroom Features

- Total_Bathrooms (computed: Full + Half×0.5 + Basement baths, 0.646 correlation)
- Full Bath (0.546 correlation)

5. Age & Timing

- House_Age (computed: Sale Year - Built Year, -0.551 correlation)
- Years_Since_Remod (computed: Sale Year - Remodel Year, -0.531 correlation)

6. Additional Size Features

- Total Bsmt SF (0.633 correlation)
- 1st Flr SF (0.624 correlation)

7. Luxury Features

- Fireplaces (0.469 correlation)
- Mas Vnr Area (0.507 correlation)

8. Location Premium

- Premium_Location (computed: 1 if in high-value neighborhoods)
- Neighborhood (for additional location nuance)

9. Condition

- Overall Cond (condition assessment)

Model Performance

- Validation Error: 0.029 (excellent)
- Test Error: 0.041 (strong generalization)
- Best Parameters: max_depth=15, min_samples_leaf=10

Key Insights

1. Computed variables significantly improve performance - Total_SF (0.796) outperforms individual area features
2. Quality encoding converts categorical quality ratings to numerical scores effectively
3. Age features are crucial - newer homes and recent renovations command higher prices
4. Location matters - premium neighborhoods provide substantial price premiums
5. Balance of features - structural, quality, location, and luxury features all contribute
